# Operating-Systems
Learning how operating systems work, the algorithms used and how to use the OS. In this course we explore: How multitasking works (i.e. how the CPU can appear to run several programs simultaneously.) • How virtual memory can allow a program (or programs) to use more memory than actually exists. • How CPU hardware is needed and used to make these capabilities secure. • Various scheduling algorithms. • How concurrent tasks can share resources safely. • How networked client-server (including cloud computing) work and how to use them. • How machine virtualization works. Although this not a programming course, you will write software in the lab. Software: C programming language is used, however we also learn a bit about shell programming. One of the lab uses Java. (since Multithreading is deeply built into the Java language)
