Learning how operating systems work, the algorithms used and how to use the OS. 
How multitasking works (i.e. how the CPU can appear to run several programs simultaneously.) • How virtual memory can allow a program (or programs) to use more memory than actually exists. • How CPU hardware is needed and used to make these capabilities secure. • Various scheduling algorithms. • How concurrent tasks can share resources safely. • How networked client-server (including cloud computing) work and how to use them. • How machine virtualization works. 

Software used: C programming language
